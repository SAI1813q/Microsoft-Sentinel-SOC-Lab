# 🛡️ Analytics Rules

Microsoft Sentinel was configured with custom Scheduled Analytics Rules to detect a broad range of adversary techniques mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. These detections leverage Windows Security Events, Sysmon logs, and custom KQL queries collected through Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) and Data Collection Rules (DCRs).

Each analytics rule continuously monitors incoming telemetry from the monitored endpoints. When predefined conditions are met, Microsoft Sentinel generates an alert, creates an incident, and triggers automated response workflows through Azure Logic Apps, enabling faster detection and response to potential security threats.

The detection rules implemented in this lab cover multiple stages of the cyber attack lifecycle, including Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Defense Evasion, and Privilege Escalation.

# 🔐 Brute Force Login Detection

## 🎯 Objective

Detect repeated failed Windows authentication attempts that may indicate a brute-force or password guessing attack against local or domain accounts. This rule enables early identification of credential-based attacks before an attacker successfully gains access.

---

## 📖 Threat Overview

Brute-force attacks involve repeatedly attempting different password combinations until valid credentials are discovered. Attackers commonly target Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), SMB, VPN services, and Active Directory accounts using automated tools to gain unauthorized access.

Monitoring failed authentication events allows Security Operations Center (SOC) analysts to quickly identify suspicious login behavior, investigate malicious source IP addresses, and take proactive actions before account compromise occurs.

## 📑 Detection Logic (KQL)

```kql
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| summarize FailedAttempts = count() by Account, IpAddress, bin(TimeGenerated, 5m)
| where FailedAttempts >= 5
| order by FailedAttempts desc
```

---

## ⚙️ Rule Configuration

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Rule Type** | Scheduled Analytics Rule | Continuously monitors incoming Windows Security Events at regular intervals. |
| **Severity** | High | Multiple failed login attempts are a strong indicator of a credential attack and require immediate investigation. |
| **Status** | Enabled | Ensures the detection is always active. |
| **Query Frequency** | Every 5 Minutes | Provides near real-time detection while keeping resource usage efficient. |
| **Lookup Period** | Last 6 Minutes | The lookup window is intentionally configured **one minute longer than the execution frequency**. This overlap prevents events from being missed due to ingestion latency or slight delays in log collection, ensuring reliable detection. |
| **Alert Threshold** | More than 0 Results | Generates an alert whenever the query identifies at least one matching brute-force activity. |
| **Event Grouping** | Trigger an alert for each event | Ensures every qualifying brute-force attempt is individually recorded before incident correlation is applied. |

---

## 🧩 Entity Mapping

The following entities are mapped to enrich Microsoft Sentinel incidents and improve investigation capabilities.

| Entity | Identifier |
|---------|------------|
| Account | Account Name |
| IP Address | Source IP Address |

### Why map these entities?

- **Account:** Identifies the user account targeted by the brute-force attack, allowing analysts to quickly determine which credentials are under attack.

- **IP Address:** Identifies the source of the authentication attempts, making it easier to investigate malicious hosts, identify repeated attacks, and perform IP-based blocking if necessary.

Entity mapping also enables Microsoft Sentinel to automatically correlate alerts and build richer investigation graphs, reducing manual analysis during incident response.

## 🚨 Alert Trigger Conditions

An alert is generated when all of the following conditions are met:

- Windows Security Event **4625 (Failed Logon)** is generated.
- Five or more failed authentication attempts occur within a **5-minute** time window.
- The scheduled KQL query returns one or more matching results.

---

## 📋 Incident Configuration

To improve incident management and reduce alert fatigue, Microsoft Sentinel is configured with the following settings:

- **Incident Creation:** Enabled to automatically create an incident whenever the analytics rule is triggered.
- **Alert Grouping:** Enabled to correlate related alerts into a single incident.
- **Grouping Time Window:** **5 Hours** to consolidate repeated brute-force attempts occurring within the selected timeframe.
- **Grouping Method:** Alerts are grouped based on the **Account** entity.

### Why group alerts by Account?

Brute-force attacks often generate dozens or even hundreds of failed authentication attempts against the **same user account**. Without grouping, each detection would create a separate incident, making investigations noisy and difficult to manage.

By grouping alerts using the **Account** entity:

- Multiple failed login attempts against the same user are consolidated into a single incident.
- Analysts receive one investigation instead of numerous duplicate incidents.
- Incident timelines become easier to review.
- Alert fatigue is significantly reduced while preserving all related events within the incident.

This configuration provides a cleaner and more efficient investigation experience for SOC analysts.

---

## 🤖 Automated Response

When an incident is created:

- The configured **Automation Rule** is executed.
- Incident ownership is automatically assigned.
- Additional playbooks, such as email notifications, can be triggered to notify SOC analysts.

---

## ✅ Validation

The detection was validated by intentionally performing multiple failed Windows logon attempts against the monitored endpoint. Microsoft Sentinel successfully generated an alert, created an incident, and executed the configured automation rule after the detection threshold was reached.

---

## 🎯 Security Impact

This detection helps security teams:

- Detect brute-force and password guessing attacks.
- Identify targeted user accounts.
- Track malicious source IP addresses.
- Reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.
- Improve incident response through automated alerting and investigation.

# 🔐 Successful Login After Brute Force

## 🎯 Objective

Detect successful authentication immediately following multiple failed login attempts against local or domain accounts. This rule enables early identification of potentially compromised credentials following a brute-force or password guessing attack, allowing analysts to respond to a successful breach.

---

## 📖 Threat Overview

Attackers frequently employ brute-force or password-spraying techniques to guess valid credentials. If the threat actor successfully identifies a password, they will typically log in to the compromised account immediately to establish initial access, maintain persistence, or move laterally within the network.

Monitoring for a successful login event (Event ID 4624) that occurs shortly after a high volume of failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) provides a high-confidence indicator of an account compromise, requiring immediate containment actions by the SOC team.

## 📑 Detection Logic (KQL)

```kql
let TimeWindow = 10m;
let FailedThreshold = 5;

let FailedLogins = 
SecurityEvent
| where EventID == 4625
| where isnotempty(IpAddress)
| where IpAddress != "-"
| summarize 
    FailedCount = count(),
    LastFailedTime = max(TimeGenerated)
    by TargetUserName, IpAddress;

let SuccessfulLogins =

| where isnotempty(IpAddress)
| where IpAddress != "-"
| project 
    SuccessTime = TimeGenerated,
    TargetUserName,
    IpAddress,
    Computer;

FailedLogins
| where FailedCount >= FailedThreshold
| join kind=inner SuccessfulLogins 
    on TargetUserName, IpAddress
| where SuccessTime between (LastFailedTime .. (LastFailedTime + TimeWindow))
| project 
    SuccessTime,
    Computer,
    TargetUserName,
    IpAddress,
    FailedCount,
    LastFailedTime
| order by SuccessTime desc
```

---

## ⚙️ Rule Configuration

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Rule Type** | Near Real-Time (NRT) Rule | Runs continuously with minimal delay to detect active compromises the moment they happen. |
| **Severity** | High | A successful login following a brute force indicates an active threat actor on the network. |
| **Status** | Enabled | Ensures the detection is always active. |
| **Event Grouping** | Trigger an alert for each event | Ensures every qualifying successful login attempt is individually recorded. |
| **Suppression** | Stop for 1 Hour | Prevents alert flooding in the event the attacker rapidly logs in and out of the compromised machine. |

---

## 🧩 Entity Mapping

The following entities are mapped to enrich Microsoft Sentinel incidents and improve investigation capabilities.

| Entity | Identifier | Field |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Account | Name | TargetUserName |
| IP Address | Address | IpAddress |

### Why map these entities?

- **Account:** Identifies the exact user account that has been compromised, allowing analysts to quickly disable the account, revoke sessions, or initiate a password reset.
- **IP Address:** Identifies the attacker's source infrastructure, making it easier to correlate with threat intelligence feeds or implement an IP block at the firewall.

Entity mapping also enables Microsoft Sentinel to automatically build richer investigation graphs, tying the failed logon events directly to the successful breach.

---

## 🚨 Alert Trigger Conditions

An alert is generated when all of the following conditions are met:

- Five or more failed authentication attempts (Event ID 4625) are logged for a specific user and IP.
- A successful Remote Interactive authentication (Event ID 4624, LogonType 10) occurs.
- The successful login matches the same `TargetUserName` and `IpAddress` and happens within a **10-minute** window of the last failed attempt.

---

## 📋 Incident Configuration

To improve incident management and reduce alert fatigue, Microsoft Sentinel is configured with the following settings:

- **Incident Creation:** Enabled to automatically create an incident whenever the analytics rule is triggered.
- **Alert Grouping:** Enabled to correlate related alerts into a single incident.
- **Grouping Time Window:** **5 Hours** to consolidate repeated cycles occurring within the selected timeframe.
- **Grouping Method:** Alerts are grouped based on the **Account (Name)** entity.

### Why group alerts by Account?

If an attacker establishes initial access, they may trigger multiple successful logins during their lateral movement or discovery phases. Grouping by the **Account** entity ensures that all alerts tied to this specific compromised identity over a 5-hour period are consolidated into a single high-priority incident for the SOC to investigate, rather than flooding the queue with duplicate tickets.

---

## 🤖 Automated Response

When an incident is created:

- The configured Automation Rule (**Account Compromise Suspected**) is executed.
- Incident tags are automatically appended for easier SOC filtering and triage.
- Playbooks can subsequently trigger logic to block the malicious IP or force a credential reset in Entra ID.

---

## ✅ Validation

The detection was validated by intentionally performing multiple failed RDP logon attempts against a monitored endpoint using an incorrect password, immediately followed by logging in successfully with the correct password. Microsoft Sentinel successfully correlated the events, generated an alert, created an incident, and executed the automation tagging rule.
